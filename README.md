# The Prison Health Project
***

We want to tell the story of how the US prison system is affecting the health of disenfranchised people.

The prison population in the US is [disproportionately affected by STI's][link1], including HIV/AIDS, compared to the general population. In this project, we use Bureau of Justice Statistics to visualize HIV prison rates vs. the general population and juxtapose HIV prison rates with incarceration rates by state.

We plan to enter this visualization to the [Beauty of Health Data][link2] competition.

## Meeting with Dr. Bob | Feb 18, 2014

We talked about HIV seropositive rates in New York, and how that tracks closely with incarceration rates. There are only a few neighborhoods that stand out... pursuing this would involve a graphical display, perhaps a map, that displays these associations. Data sets to use would be incarceration rates, HIV seropositive rates, recidivism rates.

## Kathy Boudin

She was a radical in the 60's and was incarcerated for murder. After spending time in prison, she was released and got a degree from the social work school at Columbia. She is a controversial figure in the United States because of the predominant puritanical views of crime and punishment.

> Once a murderer, always a murderer

This ties in with the story of how New York governer Cuomo is trying to pass a bill that would allow prisoners to receive a college-level education. He pushes an economic argument, saying that it costs $60,000 per year to incarcerate someone, but it only costs $5,000 to give prisoners a college education. The strength of this argument is also contingent upon the notion that this would decrease recidivism rates and thus decrease costs even further.

One of the fundamental questions in pursuing this thread is the idea of criminal justice as protective vs. corrective. Is the point of the criminal justice system to partition criminals from the innocent, or is it to ensure that the criminal have the resources to address the underlying factors that drove them to crime in the first place?

For the parameters of this competition, we would use text data from news media websites to perform sentiment analysis on what kind of language is being used to talk about the issue of crime, prison, parole, and redemption. We would also have to explicitly (or maybe not?) tie it in with health. We can look into what other kinds of policies Governor Cuomo is pushing to see how people view the medical care and treatment of inmates.

## Politics of Comparison
An interesting thread we also brought up was the notion that people in the US often compare the US to other developed countries in Europe, and how in fact the US is often times a model for these other countries with regard to certain issues such as civil rights, gender equality, etc.
