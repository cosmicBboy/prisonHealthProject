#The Prison HIV Project
---

We want to tell the story of how the US prison system is affecting the health of disenfranchised people.

The prison population in the US is [disproportionately affected by STI's][link1], including HIV/AIDS, compared to the general population. In this project, we use Bureau of Justice statistics to visualize HIV prison rates vs. the general population and juxtapose HIV prison rates with incarceration rates by state.

We plan to enter this visualization to the [Beauty of Health Data][link2] competition.
