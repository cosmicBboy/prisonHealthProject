An ancillary objective of the project was to illustrate the utility of the
resulting data archive. This was done by addressing three research issues:
a uniform set of analyses across States, counties, and cities; an
assessment of the conditional effects of economic conditions on recent
crime trends; and an expanded analysis of the effects of key criminal
justice features on recent crime trends that have not been widely
considered in prior research. These criminal justice features include the
nature of policing and age-specific and crime-specific imprisonment rates.
The specific samples, time frames, and measures used varied across the
three issues addressed; however, the general analytical strategy in
addressing these issues is to construct, when possible, a panel database
with requisite measures focused on the following time points: 1980, 1985,
1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010. This was done using the Crime Trends Data
Archive (CTDA) produced by the project. This approach benefits from the
strength of a pooled cross-sectional design, while avoiding the data
imputation that is required to support panel analyses of annual time
periods for sub-national geographic units. The three sets of empirical
analyses conducted in this project include models of overall homicide, non-
lethal violence (robbery and aggravated assault), and non-violent property
crime (burglary, motor vehicle theft, and larceny). The project estimated a
series of two-way fixed-effects panel models of crime rates that include
fixed effects that control for stable, but unmeasured, city attributes and
temporal shocks that are shared across cities. This report also identifies
factors that influence crime rates, including criminal justice policies and
practices.

State and federal prisons reported holding 22,713 inmates who were HIV
positive in 1994. The inmates were 2.3% of the total prison population,
about the same percentage as in 1991. Among state prisoners, women (3.9%)
were more likely than men (2.4%) to be HIV positive. Almost 5,000 inmates,
1/2 of 1% of all prisoners, had confirmed AIDS at yearend 1994; this rate
was seven times that of the general population. For each state and the
federal prison system, the report provides the number of HIV-positive and
active AIDS inmates, the number of AIDS-related deaths, and HIV-testing
policies.

By the end of 1982, the number of inmates under sentence of death stood at
1,050, the largest ever recorded in the Nation. The number of persons
sentenced to death in 1982 was 264, higher than in any other year except
1975. Departures from Death Row by means other than execution fell to 68,
one of the smallest totals in recent history. The large number of persons
on Death Row in 1982 reflected both an increase in the number of death
sentences handed down over the years and lengthened stays because of long
appeals. Pertinent judicial decisions (such as Furman v. Georgia, Eddings
v. Oklahoma, and State v. Logan) are discussed in relation to capital
punishment. Two tables, one graph, and eight recommended readings are
supplied.

Presents data on prisoners under the jurisdiction of federal and state
correctional authorities on December 31, 2011, collected from the National
Prisoner Statistics series. The report compares changes in the prison
population during 2011 to changes from yearend 2000 through yearend 2010.
It explores factors leading to the second straight year of decline in the
state prison population, as well as continued growth in the federal prison
population. Findings cover data on decreasing admissions and releases in
state prisons; imprisonment rates for prisoners sentenced to more than one
year, by jurisdiction, age, race, Hispanic origin, sex, and offense
distributions of prisoners; and the contribution of Californiaâs new
Public Safety Realignment policy on the national state prison population.

The inmate population increased by 134 percent between 1980 and 1990, with
a growth rate of 8.2 percent during 1990. The number of male inmates
increased 8.3 percent, while the number of female inmates increased 7.9
percent. Prisoners with sentences of more than 1 year accounted for 96
percent of the year-end population. The others were awaiting trials or had
sentences of a year or less. The number of sentenced prisoner per 100,000
residents reached a new record of 293 at the end of 1990. Prison
populations increased the fastest in western States. Local jails held more
than 18,000 State prisoners because of crowding in State facilities.
Finally, the prison population growth may reflect the increasing certainty
of punishment. Tables and notes

capacities and use of local jails because of prison crowding. Highlights
include the following: During 1997 the number of female prisoners rose by
6.2%, slightly greater than the increase in male prisoners (5.2%). At
yearend 1997, 79,624 women were in State or Federal prisons -- 6.4% of all
prison inmates. On December 31, 1997, State prisons were operating at
between 15% and 24% above capacity, while Federal prisons were operating at
19% above capacity. California (157,547), Texas (140,729), and the Federal
system (112,973) together held 1 in every 3 prisoners in the Nation.
Fifteen States, each holding fewer than 5,000 inmates, together held only
4% of the Nation's prisoners.

The prison population increased 7.4 percent during the year, a slightly
higher rate than in 1987. The 1988 increase of 43,000 prisoners equals a
demand for more than 800 new prison beds per week. The number of prisoners
at the end of the year set a new record for the 14th consecutive year. The
number of sentenced prisoners per 100,000 residents was 244, also setting a
new record. The growth was higher in the western States than in the other
regions. In addition, female inmates increased more rapidly than male
inmates. More than 14,000 State inmates were held in local jails because of
crowding in State facilities. Most jurisdictions were operating above their
reported capacity. Data tables and explanatory notes for each State.

At the end of the year, 1,405 prisoners were under sentence of death, and
21 had been executed. All these prisoners were convicted of murder.
Seventeen were female; two-thirds had a prior felony conviction. Nearly 63
percent were held by States in the south, 21 percent by western States, 12
percent by north central States, and 4 percent by northeastern States. U.S.
Supreme Court decisions struck down State law requiring the death penalty
for specified crimes and established that a State need not require a review
of each sentence for its proportionality with comparable cases. It also
held that jurors could be excused if the trial judge deemed their views on
the death penalty as preventing or impairing the performance of their
duties. At yearend, 37 States and the Federal Government had laws
authorizing the death penalty. New York and Massachusetts struck down the
death penalty through court decisions. Nine States changed their existing
death penalty laws. Eight States provided for more than one method of
execution. Twenty-one States specified a minimum age for imposing the death
penalty. Data tables on the criminal histories of those under sentence of

It also provides information from State inmates reporting on their personal
characteristics and how these relate to HIV test results. Nationwide,
prison authorities in 1991 reported that 2.2 percent of those confined in
State and Federal facilities had tested positive for HIV. That same year,
in a nationally representative sample survey of State prisoners, 2.2
percent were estimated to be HIV- positive, based on interviews with
prisoners. These comparable rates suggest that important and useful
information about HIV exposure can be reliably obtained from inmates. Jail
and prison inmates are at greater risk than others of contracting AIDS
because of their comparatively high rates of drug abuse. Tables and

The introduction reviews the history of U.S. corrections statistics,
defines common terms used in tables, and briefly profiles data sources.
Data tables pertaining to jail inmates cover 1-day counts and average daily
population by legal status and sex for 1983, 1985, and 1986; detention
status by sex for 1983, 1985, and 1986; demographic characteristics of jail
inmates for 1985 and 1986; and annual jail admissions and releases by legal
status and sex for 1983, 1985, and 1986. One table addresses jail capacity
and occupancy. Data on jails in jurisdictions with large jail populations
address the impact of inmates held for other authorities, rated capacity
and percent of capacity occupied, number of jails under court order to
reduce population or to improve confinement conditions, and inmate deaths.
Others tables pertain to probation, prison inmates, parole, and capital
punishment. Each topical section of tables contains explanatory notes and
relevant questionnaires. Subject index.

The introduction reviews the history of U.S. corrections statistics,
defines common terms used in tables, and briefly profiles data sources.
Data tables pertaining to jail inmates cover 1-day counts and average daily
population by legal status and sex for 1983, 1985, and 1986; detention
status by sex for 1983, 1985, and 1986; demographic characteristics of jail
inmates for 1985 and 1986; and annual jail admissions and releases by legal
status and sex for 1983, 1985, and 1986. One table addresses jail capacity
and occupancy. Data on jails in jurisdictions with large jail populations
address the impact of inmates held for other authorities, rated capacity
and percent of capacity occupied, number of jails under court order to
reduce population or to improve confinement conditions, and inmate deaths.
Others tables pertain to probation, prison inmates, parole, and capital
punishment. Each topical section of tables contains explanatory notes and
relevant questionnaires. Subject index.

Provides the number of HIV-positive and active AIDS cases among prisoners
held in each state and the federal prison system at yearend 1995. For
prisons, the report provides data on the number of AIDS-related deaths,
HIV-testing policies, a breakdown for women and men with AIDS, and
comparisons to AIDS rates in the general populations. For local jail
inmates in 1995, the report gives national estimates of the percentage of
HIV-positive persons or confirmed AIDS cases. Based on the recently
completed 1995-96 survey of inmates in local jails, the report also
provides such estimates by sex, race, Hispanic origin, age, education,
marital status, and current offense and estimates by selected risk factors,
such as prior drug use.

The inmate population increased by 150 percent between 1980 and 1991, with
a growth rate of 6.2 percent during 1991. The number of male inmates
increased 6.1 percent, while the number of female inmates increased 7.8
percent. Prisoners with sentences of more than 1 year accounted for 96
percent of the year-end population. The others were awaiting trials or had
sentences of a year or less. The number of sentenced prisoner per 100,000
residents reached a new record of 310 at the end of 1991. Prison
populations increased the fastest in northeastern States. Local jails held
more than 12,000 State prisoners because of crowding in State facilities.

This report presents findings by year from 2000 to 2010 and analyzes 11-
year trends in deaths in custody. Also provided are mortality rates per
100,000 inmates in custody in jail or prison, detailed cause of death
(including deaths attributed to homicide, suicide, illness, intoxication,
and accidental injury), as well as decedents' characteristics (including
age, race/Hispanic origin, sex, legal status, and time served). Results
indicate that the number of inmates who died while in the custody of local
jails declined in 2010, falling to 918 from the 951 deaths in 2009,
representing the third consecutive annual decrease since the number of jail
deaths peaked at 1,100 in 2007; in 2010, males accounted for nearly 9 out
of 10 jail inmate deaths (88 percent). In any single year between 2000 and
2010, males accounted for no less than 87 percent of jail deaths,
California, Texas, New York, and Florida together reported about a third of
jail deaths in 2010, and the largest jail populations, comprising 32
percent of the total jail population in 2010; the number of inmates who
died while in the custody of State prisons declined from 3,414 in 2009 to
3,232 in 2010, for a total decrease of 5 percent, which is the largest
decline in the number of prison deaths since the DCRP began collecting
prisoner mortality data in 2001; in 2010, males accounted for nearly all
prisoner deaths (96 percent), and in any single year between 2001 and 2010,
males accounted for no less than 95 percent of prison deaths. Data were
collected from the Bureau of Justice Statistics' Deaths in Custody
Reporting Program (DCRP), and the National Prisoner Statistics series.

This annual report compares changes in the prison population during 2008 to
changes from yearend 2000 through yearend 2007. These are the only
comprehensive national-level data on prison admissions and releases.
Findings cover data on decreasing growth in State and Federal prisons
through declining admissions and increasing releases; imprisonment rates
for prisoners sentenced to more than 1 year by jurisdiction; the number of
males and females in prison; age, race, and gender distributions; the
number of inmates in custody in State and Federal prison and local jails;
and custody incarceration rates. The report also includes the count for
inmates held within facilities operated by and for the military, U.S.
territories, Indian country, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and
juvenile authorities. Highlights include the following: the U.S. prison
population grew at the slowest rate (0.8 percent) since 2000, reaching
1,610,446 sentenced prisoners at yearend 2008; growth of the prison
population since 2000 (1.8 percent per year on average) was less than a
third of the average annual rate during the 1990s (6.5 percent per year on
average); between 2000 and 2008 the number of blacks in prison declined by
18,400, lowering the imprisonment rate to 3,161 men and 149 women per
100,000 persons in the U.S. resident black population.
