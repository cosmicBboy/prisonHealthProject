This just in:  Its the military--not California!  You don't get to choose.  You are what you came to the party as.

Shades of D-movie director and cross dresser, Ed Wood and Glen to Glenda. Too bad he's been dead for over 50 years. Bradley to Brandi would make a good sequel.

"Doing the right thing" would be summary execution for Manning. 
Or is that "Womanning"  ?

I have no problem he wants to become a she. However, he needs to pay for the sex change himself. It is an identity crisis, not like he is ill. Taxpayers shouldn't be responsible for his sex change bills.

No it doesn't. Manning didn't sell state secrets to fund a sex change operation.

LGBT's such a warm, loving, caring and important part to our society! Don't we all just love having them around to influence our kids and our kids future, OUR future! I don't think life would be the same without these inspiring freak-a-zoids. Hold on I need to puke... OK, I feel so much better. As I was saying, beautiful people making our lives better, day in and day out!

Once anyone becomes a "Prisioner" I feel they have lost all their rights once convicted of their crimes. If they have the funds needed to get a medical procude done once their sentence is served then they can have the procure done butnot while in prison for something else.
Their in prison to do their time, not use it as a country club or medical clinic for whatever weird fantasies they have on the taxpayers dime.
We need to do something to change the way our prisoners or prisons are set up so that the criminal is there to do some hard time, not get medical procures done while incarserated so they can do their recovering while still in jail etc.
Theirs something major wrong with any prison that allows this to happen. Whatever happened to a prision that was for criminal to suffer for their crimes? No wonder these people keep commiting crimes!

Tasteless article. Transgender people have been around all throughout human history. This article makes it seem as if Manning is copying a TV show's plot, and gives off the whole "Being LGBTQ is a fad" misconception which responsible media outlets should be combatting, not furthering. Shame on the author.
